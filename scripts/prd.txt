Core Value Proposition: Accelerate the evaluate → debug → iterate flywheel to ship better AI products faster

## System Architecture Overview

### Three-Tier Evaluation System
1. Level 1: Unit Tests - Automated assertions and functional tests
2. Level 2: Model & Human Evaluation - Qualitative review with labeling
3. Level 3: A/B Testing - Product-level impact measurement

### Core Components
- Trace Logger - Capture and store LLM interactions
- Test Runner - Execute automated test suites
- Evaluation Dashboard - Human review interface
- Analytics Engine - Metrics tracking and reporting
- A/B Testing Framework - Experiment management

## Detailed Feature Requirements

### Sprint 1-2: Core Infrastructure (4 weeks)

#### Trace Logging System
User Story: As a developer, I want to automatically capture all LLM interactions so I can analyze and debug my system's behavior.

Requirements:
- LangSmith Setup: Configure LangSmith project and API keys
- Trace Ingestion: Use LangSmith's tracing APIs for automatic capture
- Data Sync: Build webhooks/ETL to sync relevant traces to your database
- Custom Metadata: Extend traces with your application-specific data

Acceptance Criteria:
- Automatic trace capture with minimal code changes
- Traces include full context (system prompts, user input, model output, tool calls)
- Web interface to browse and search traces (LangSmith UI + custom views)
- Export traces as JSON/CSV for custom analysis

#### Database Schema
Database tables needed:
- traces (id, timestamp, session_id, user_id, model_name, system_prompt, user_input, model_output, metadata, latency_ms, token_count, cost_usd, status)
- evaluations (id, trace_id, evaluator_type, score, label, critique, evaluated_at, evaluator_id)
- test_cases (id, name, input, expected_output, assertion_type, tags, created_at)
- experiments (id, name, description, status, start_date, end_date, metrics)

### Sprint 3-4: Unit Testing Framework (4 weeks)

#### Automated Test Runner
User Story: As a developer, I want to run automated tests on every code change to catch obvious LLM failures early.

Requirements:
- Test Case Management: Create, edit, and organize test cases
- Assertion Types: Contains/doesn't contain specific text, sentiment analysis, JSON schema validation, custom function-based assertions
- CI/CD Integration: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI hooks
- Batch Testing: Run tests against multiple models/configurations
- Regression Detection: Compare current vs. baseline performance

Acceptance Criteria:
- Web UI for creating/editing test cases
- Command-line test runner
- Pass/fail reporting with detailed logs
- Integration with popular CI/CD platforms
- Parallel test execution

### Sprint 5-7: Human & Model Evaluation (6 weeks)

#### Evaluation Dashboard
User Story: As a PM/researcher, I want to systematically review LLM outputs and build labeled datasets for improvement.

Key Features:
- Clean Review Interface with Chat/Functions/Metadata tabs
- Large Accept/Reject buttons with visual feedback
- Record navigation (X of Y) with pagination
- Editable output field for creating training examples

#### Advanced Filtering & Taxonomy System
User Story: As an evaluator, I want to filter traces by multiple dimensions to focus my review time and identify patterns.

Multi-Dimensional Filtering:
- Tool/Function Filter: Filter by specific AI capabilities
- Scenario Filter: Bottom-up taxonomies from real data
- Status Filter: Evaluation workflow states
- Data Source Filter: Origin of the interaction

#### Model-Based Evaluation
User Story: As an ML engineer, I want to use LLMs to automatically evaluate other LLM outputs at scale.

Requirements:
- Evaluator Model Integration: Support OpenAI, Anthropic, local models
- Prompt Templates: Pre-built evaluation prompts for common use cases
- Scoring Calibration: Align model scores with human judgment
- Batch Processing: Evaluate thousands of traces automatically
- Quality Metrics: Track evaluator model consistency and accuracy

### Sprint 8-10: A/B Testing Framework (6 weeks)

#### Experiment Management
User Story: As a PM, I want to run controlled experiments to measure the product impact of LLM changes.

Requirements:
- Experiment Setup: Define treatment groups, traffic allocation, success metrics
- User Segmentation: Route users to different model versions
- Metrics Tracking: Custom KPIs, conversion rates, user satisfaction
- Statistical Analysis: Confidence intervals, significance testing
- Experiment Dashboard: Real-time results and decision support

### Sprint 11-12: Polish & Scale (4 weeks)
- Performance optimization and scaling
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Documentation and onboarding flows
- Integration testing and bug fixes

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack (Recommended)
- Trace Logging: LangSmith for core tracing and chain visualization
- Backend: Python (FastAPI) for custom evaluation logic and APIs
- Database: PostgreSQL for custom test cases, experiments, user data
- Frontend: React/Next.js for custom dashboards and A/B testing UI
- Queue: Redis/Celery for background evaluation jobs
- Analytics: LangSmith analytics + custom dashboards for A/B testing

### Integration Points
- Primary Tracing: LangSmith API for trace ingestion and basic evaluation
- LLM Providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, local models via APIs
- Custom Logic: Your platform for advanced unit tests, A/B testing, custom metrics
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins webhooks
- Data Pipeline: LangSmith webhooks + ETL jobs for custom analytics

## Success Metrics

### Product Metrics
- Adoption: Number of active teams using the platform
- Usage: Traces logged per day, tests executed per week
- Quality: Reduction in production issues, faster iteration cycles
- Efficiency: Time from model change to production deployment

### Technical Metrics
- Performance: API response times < 200ms, 99.9% uptime
- Scale: Handle 10K+ traces per hour, support 100+ concurrent users
- Reliability: Zero data loss, automated backup and recovery

## Development Resources

### Required Team
- Full-stack Developer (2-3 developers)
- ML/AI Engineer (1 developer for model integration)
- Product Manager (1 PM for coordination)
- Designer (0.5 FTE for UI/UX)

### Estimated Timeline
- MVP: 8-10 weeks
- Full Platform: 20-24 weeks
- Maintenance: Ongoing

This platform succeeds when teams can:
1. Debug faster: Identify LLM issues within hours, not days
2. Iterate confidently: Deploy changes knowing they've been properly tested
3. Optimize systematically: Use data to drive product decisions
4. Scale quality: Maintain high standards as the product grows
