## üìã Detailed Feature Requirements

### üîß Core Infrastructure (Sprint 1-2)

#### Trace Logging System
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically capture all LLM interactions so I can analyze and debug my system's behavior.

**Option A: LangSmith Integration (Recommended)**
- **LangSmith Setup**: Configure LangSmith project and API keys
- **Trace Ingestion**: Use LangSmith's tracing APIs for automatic capture
- **Data Sync**: Build webhooks/ETL to sync relevant traces to your database
- **Custom Metadata**: Extend traces with your application-specific data

**Option B: Custom Trace System**
- **Trace Capture API**: RESTful endpoints to log LLM requests/responses
- **Structured Storage**: Store traces with metadata (timestamp, user_id, model, prompt, response, latency, tokens)
- **Query Interface**: Filter traces by date, model, user, success/failure
- **Integration SDK**: Simple Python/JavaScript clients for common frameworks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Automatic trace capture with minimal code changes
- [ ] Traces include full context (system prompts, user input, model output, tool calls)
- [ ] Web interface to browse and search traces (LangSmith UI + custom views)
- [ ] Export traces as JSON/CSV for custom analysis

#### Database Schema
```sql
traces (id, timestamp, session_id, user_id, model_name, system_prompt, user_input, model_output, metadata, latency_ms, token_count, cost_usd, status)
evaluations (id, trace_id, evaluator_type, score, label, critique, evaluated_at, evaluator_id)
test_cases (id, name, input, expected_output, assertion_type, tags, created_at)
experiments (id, name, description, status, start_date, end_date, metrics)
```

### üß™ Level 1: Unit Testing Framework (Sprint 3-4)

#### Automated Test Runner
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run automated tests on every code change to catch obvious LLM failures early.

**Requirements:**
- **Test Case Management**: Create, edit, and organize test cases
- **Assertion Types**: 
  - Contains/doesn't contain specific text
  - Sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
  - JSON schema validation
  - Custom function-based assertions
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI hooks
- **Batch Testing**: Run tests against multiple models/configurations
- **Regression Detection**: Compare current vs. baseline performance

**Test Case Editor Interface:**
```yaml
Test Case: Customer Service Response
Input: "I'm angry about my delayed order"
Assertions:
  - contains: ["sorry", "apologize", "understand"]
  - sentiment: "empathetic"
  - not_contains: ["your fault", "too bad"]
  - response_time: < 5000ms
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Web UI for creating/editing test cases
- [ ] Command-line test runner
- [ ] Pass/fail reporting with detailed logs
- [ ] Integration with popular CI/CD platforms
- [ ] Parallel test execution

### üß† Level 2: Human & Model Evaluation (Sprint 5-7)

#### Evaluation Dashboard
**User Story:** As a PM/researcher, I want to systematically review LLM outputs and build labeled datasets for improvement.

**Key Features (Inspired by Reference Dashboard):**
- **Clean Review Interface**: 
  - Chat/Functions/Metadata tabs for organized viewing
  - Large Accept/Reject buttons with visual feedback
  - Record navigation (X of Y) with pagination
  - Editable output field for creating training examples

#### Advanced Filtering & Taxonomy System
**User Story:** As an evaluator, I want to filter traces by multiple dimensions to focus my review time and identify patterns.

**Multi-Dimensional Filtering:**
- **Tool/Function Filter**: Filter by specific AI capabilities
  - Examples: `document-search`, `code-generation`, `email-draft`, `data-analysis`
  - Enables debugging specific tool performance
- **Scenario Filter**: Bottom-up taxonomies from real data
  - Auto-suggested based on trace content analysis
  - Examples: `price-inquiry`, `technical-support`, `feature-request`
  - Manually editable and extensible
- **Status Filter**: Evaluation workflow states
  - `Pending` (awaiting human review)
  - `Accepted` (human approved)
  - `Rejected` (human rejected)
  - `In-Review` (assigned to evaluator)
- **Data Source Filter**: Origin of the interaction
  - `Human` (real user interactions)
  - `Synthetic` (AI-generated test cases)
  - `Regression` (automated test suite)

**Dynamic Taxonomy Building:**
- **Auto-Detection**: Use LLMs to suggest scenario categories from trace content
- **Manual Tagging**: Allow evaluators to create custom tags
- **Tag Suggestions**: Propose tags based on similar traces
- **Taxonomy Analytics**: Show which scenarios have highest/lowest performance

**Advanced Filter Combinations:**
- Multi-select within categories
- Cross-category filtering (e.g., "Rejected" + "Email-Draft" + "Human")
- Saved filter presets for common evaluations
- URL-based filter sharing for team collaboration

**Implementation Notes:**
```sql
-- Enhanced schema for taxonomy
trace_tags (trace_id, tag_type, tag_value, confidence_score, created_by)
tag_types: 'tool', 'scenario', 'topic', 'user_intent', 'difficulty'

-- Filter query example
SELECT * FROM traces t
JOIN trace_tags tt ON t.id = tt.trace_id
WHERE tt.tag_type = 'tool' AND tt.tag_value = 'email-draft'
  AND t.status = 'rejected'
  AND t.data_source = 'human'
```

- **Critical Metrics Tracking**:
  - **LLM ‚Üî Human Agreement Rate** (shows evaluation quality)
  - **Human Acceptance Rate** (shows overall quality trends)
  - Time-series charts showing improvement over time
- **Data Export**: Export labeled data for fine-tuning

**Advanced Features:**
- **Queue Management**: Assign traces to specific reviewers
- **Bulk Operations**: Accept/reject multiple records
- **Critique System**: Optional detailed feedback on rejections
- **Custom Taxonomies**: Beyond binary, support multi-label evaluation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Clean, fast interface matching reference design quality
- [ ] Real-time metrics updates as evaluations are completed
- [ ] Support for editing assistant outputs to create ideal responses
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- [ ] Export formats optimized for fine-tuning (JSONL, etc.)

#### Model-Based Evaluation
**User Story:** As an ML engineer, I want to use LLMs to automatically evaluate other LLM outputs at scale.

**Requirements:**
- **Evaluator Model Integration**: Support OpenAI, Anthropic, local models
- **Prompt Templates**: Pre-built evaluation prompts for common use cases
- **Scoring Calibration**: Align model scores with human judgment
- **Batch Processing**: Evaluate thousands of traces automatically
- **Quality Metrics**: Track evaluator model consistency and accuracy

### üìä Level 3: A/B Testing Framework (Sprint 8-10)

#### Experiment Management
**User Story:** As a PM, I want to run controlled experiments to measure the product impact of LLM changes.

**Requirements:**
- **Experiment Setup**: Define treatment groups, traffic allocation, success metrics
- **User Segmentation**: Route users to different model versions
- **Metrics Tracking**: Custom KPIs, conversion rates, user satisfaction
- **Statistical Analysis**: Confidence intervals, significance testing
- **Experiment Dashboard**: Real-time results and decision support

**Experiment Configuration:**
```yaml
Experiment: Improved Customer Support Bot
Traffic Split: 50/50
Duration: 2 weeks
Primary Metric: Customer Satisfaction Score
Secondary Metrics:
  - Resolution Rate
  - Response Time
