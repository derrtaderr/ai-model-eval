# Task ID: 11
# Title: Performance Optimization & Scaling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize platform performance and implement scaling solutions for high-volume usage
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations including database indexing, query optimization, caching strategies with Redis, horizontal scaling capabilities, load balancing, and achieve target metrics of <200ms API response times and 99.9% uptime.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Database Indexing and Query Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement database indexing and optimize queries to improve database performance
### Details:
Analyze slow queries, create appropriate indexes on frequently accessed columns, optimize JOIN operations, and use EXPLAIN to verify query execution plans
<info added on 2025-06-01T23:10:27.986Z>
Database optimization completed:

1. Database Indexing Analysis:
   - Reviewed existing indexes in backend/database/models.py
   - Confirmed comprehensive indexing implementation
   - Includes single column, composite, performance range, and foreign key indexes

2. Query Optimization:
   - Updated backend/database/connection.py with optimized settings
   - Implemented connection pooling (pool_size: 10, max_overflow: 20, timeout: 30s)
   - Added connection parameter optimizations (JIT disabled, command timeout, application name, pool pre-ping)
   - Implemented database health check and stats functions
   - Enabled SQLAlchemy 2.0 style and manual flush control

3. Performance Configuration:
   - Created backend/config/performance.py with comprehensive settings
   - Configured database pool, performance monitoring, rate limiting, and cache TTL settings

Database layer now optimized for high-performance production use with proper indexing, connection pooling, and monitoring capabilities.

## 2. Implement Redis Caching Strategy [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Design and implement a caching strategy using Redis to reduce database load and improve response times
### Details:
Identify frequently accessed data, implement cache invalidation mechanisms, and use Redis for caching API responses and database query results
<info added on 2025-06-01T23:11:03.576Z>
Redis caching implementation completed:

1. Cache Service Architecture:
   - Created backend/services/cache_service.py with Redis-based caching
   - Implemented CacheService class with key management and TTL
   - Built cache decorators for API responses and database queries
   - Added cache invalidation patterns for user, trace, and experiment data
   - Serialization support for JSON and pickle

2. Performance Configuration:
   - Optimized Redis connection settings (connection pooling, timeouts, health checks)
   - Configured TTL for different data types (trace stats, user sessions, experiment results, dashboard analytics, model configs)

3. API Integration:
   - Applied caching to backend/api/traces.py endpoints
   - Implemented cache invalidation on data mutations
   - Proper cache key generation with parameter hashing

4. Cache Management:
   - Built CacheManager class with monitoring, cleanup, and admin functions
   - Added cache health checks and error handling
   - Implemented graceful fallback for Redis unavailability

5. Dependency Updates:
   - Added redis==5.0.1 and hiredis==2.2.3 to requirements.txt

Caching strategy now fully implemented with intelligent invalidation, performance monitoring, and production-ready error handling.

## 3. API Optimization and Response Time Reduction [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Optimize API endpoints to achieve target response times of <200ms
### Details:
Profile API endpoints, optimize code execution, implement pagination and request throttling, and use asynchronous processing where appropriate
<info added on 2025-06-01T23:11:37.430Z>
API optimization and middleware implementation completed:

1. Performance Monitoring Middleware:
   - Implemented in backend/middleware/performance.py
   - Tracks API response times, request/error metrics, slow requests
   - Generates request IDs for tracing
   - Adds performance headers (X-Process-Time, X-Request-ID)
   - Real-time metrics collection and caching in Redis

2. Rate Limiting Middleware:
   - Configurable limits per endpoint (e.g., 1000/minute default, 10/minute for auth)
   - IP-based rate limiting with sliding window
   - HTTP 429 responses with retry-after headers
   - Rate limit headers added

3. Response Compression:
   - CompressionMiddleware for gzip compression
   - Automatic compression for JSON responses > 1KB
   - Client accept-encoding detection

4. FastAPI App Integration:
   - Updated backend/main.py with all performance middleware
   - Added performance monitoring endpoints
   - Enhanced health check
   - Cache service initialization in lifespan

5. Request Optimization:
   - Implemented asynchronous processing
   - Added pagination and request throttling
   - Configured response size limits

API now optimized for <200ms response times with monitoring, rate limiting, and caching strategies in place.

## 4. Background Job Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Optimize background job processing to improve overall system performance
