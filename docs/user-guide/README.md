## Core Features

### Trace Management

**What are Traces?**
Traces are records of interactions between users and your AI system. Each trace contains:
- User input (the question or prompt)
- AI output (the response)
- Metadata (model used, timing, cost)
- Context (session, user information)

**Viewing Traces**:
1. Navigate to the "Traces" section
2. Use filters to find specific traces:
   - Date range
   - Model name
   - Session ID
   - User tags
3. Click on a trace to see detailed information
4. Review associated evaluations and test results

**Searching Traces**:
- Use the search bar for keyword searches
- Apply multiple filters simultaneously
- Save common search queries for quick access
- Export filtered results for analysis

### Evaluation Workflows

**Creating Evaluations**:
1. Select a trace to evaluate
2. Choose evaluation criteria (accuracy, helpfulness, etc.)
3. Provide scores (typically 1-5 scale)
4. Add written feedback and suggestions
5. Submit for review or approval

**Evaluation Guidelines**:
- Be consistent in your scoring approach
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Consider the context and user intent
- Flag any safety or ethical concerns

**Batch Evaluation**:
- Evaluate multiple traces at once
- Use templates for consistent criteria
- Track progress through evaluation queues
- Collaborate with other evaluators

### A/B Testing

**Setting Up Experiments**:
1. Define your hypothesis (e.g., "Model A will have higher user satisfaction")
2. Configure variants (control vs treatment)
3. Set traffic allocation (e.g., 50/50 split)
4. Define success metrics
5. Set sample size and duration
6. Launch the experiment

**Monitoring Experiments**:
- Track participant enrollment
- Monitor key metrics in real-time
- Check for statistical significance
- Watch for any issues or anomalies

**Analyzing Results**:
- Review statistical test results
- Compare variant performance
- Consider practical significance vs statistical significance
- Make deployment decisions based on data

### Analytics and Reporting

**Performance Dashboards**:
- Model performance over time
- Cost and latency trends
- User satisfaction metrics
- Error rates and failure modes

**Custom Reports**:
- Filter data by various dimensions
- Create visualizations and charts
- Schedule automated report generation
- Share reports with stakeholders

**Data Export**:
- Export traces and evaluations
- Choose from multiple formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- Include or exclude specific fields
- Set up automated exports

## Best Practices

### For Evaluation Quality

1. **Establish Clear Criteria**: Define what makes a good response
2. **Train Evaluators**: Ensure consistent understanding of standards
3. **Use Multiple Evaluators**: Get diverse perspectives on quality

5. **Document Edge Cases**: Build a knowledge base of difficult scenarios

### For A/B Testing

1. **Plan Before Testing**: Define clear hypotheses and success metrics
2. **Ensure Statistical Power**: Use appropriate sample sizes
3. **Avoid Peeking**: Don't stop tests early based on interim results
4. **Consider Practical Significance**: Statistical significance â‰  business impact
5. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of test configurations

### For Data Management

1. **Consistent Tagging**: Use standardized tags for easy filtering
2. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive old data and remove duplicates
3. **Privacy Compliance**: Follow data protection regulations
4. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure evaluation data is properly backed up
5. **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive data appropriately

### For Integration

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a subset of your traffic
2. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for any impact on system performance
3. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful fallbacks for API failures
4. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits and implement backoff strategies
5. **Version Control**: Track changes to evaluation criteria and test suites

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"I can't see any traces"**
- Check if your API integration is working correctly
- Verify that traces are being sent to the correct endpoint
- Ensure you have the right permissions to view traces
- Check date filters - you might be looking at the wrong time period

**"My evaluations aren't saving"**
- Ensure all required fields are filled out
- Check your internet connection
- Verify you have evaluation permissions
- Try refreshing the page and submitting again

**"Experiment results look wrong"**
- Verify your experiment configuration
- Check if there's sufficient data for statistical analysis
- Ensure traffic is being split correctly
- Look for any data quality issues

**"API calls are failing"**
- Check your API key is correct and hasn't expired
- Verify the endpoint URL is correct
- Ensure you're not hitting rate limits
- Check the API documentation for required parameters

### Performance Issues

**Slow Loading**:
- Try reducing the number of traces displayed
- Use more specific filters to narrow results
- Check your internet connection
- Clear your browser cache

**Timeout Errors**:
- Reduce the date range for large queries
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Try the query during off-peak hours
- Contact support if issues persist
